# Hex_Softwares_Malaria_Detection_with_ML
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect malaria parasites in blood smear images. Leveraging image processing and deep learning techniques, the model helps automate and expedite the process of diagnosing malaria, particularly in areas with limited access to healthcare professionals.
